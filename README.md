# Electricity-Consumption
This project analyzes the relationship between solar electricity generation and electricity usage throughout 2020, using hourly data measurements. The analysis includes:

Hourly electricity consumption and solar generation patterns
Battery storage simulation with a 10kWh capacity
Cost analysis based on electricity prices
Visualization of energy usage patterns and battery charge levels
The project demonstrates the interplay between solar generation peaks (midday) and electricity usage peaks (morning/evening), providing insights for energy optimization and storage strategies. Built using Python, the analysis utilizes pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualization.

Key components:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Time-series analysis of energy patterns
Battery charge simulation
Cost-benefit analysis of battery storage
Interactive visualizations of energy consumption patterns
This repository can be useful for anyone interested in residential energy consumption analysis, solar power integration, or battery storage optimization.
